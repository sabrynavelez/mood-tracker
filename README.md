## Future Improvements
While the Daily Mood Tracker app is simple and functional, there are several features and improvements I plan to add to make it more robust and engaging:

Data Visualization: Add charts or graphs to visualize mood trends over time (e.g., a line chart showing mood progress or a pie chart for mood distribution).

Mood Analytics: Provide insights and recommendations based on users' mood patterns, like suggesting tips for improvement or reflecting on the most common moods.

User Authentication: Implement user sign-up and login (using Firebase Authentication) so users can securely track their moods over multiple devices.

Mood Reminders: Allow users to set reminders to update their mood at certain times of the day, encouraging consistent tracking.

Customizable Mood Options: Let users create and customize their own moods, emojis, and categories to make the app more personalized.

Dark Mode: Implement a dark theme for better usability at night or in low-light environments.

Mobile App Version: Convert this project into a fully native mobile app using React Native to reach more users on their smartphones.
